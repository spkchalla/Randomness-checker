# RNG Testing Assignment – Cryptography & Network Security

## Overview

This assignment evaluates the randomness of sequences generated by different random number generators (RNGs) using statistical tests.

**RNGs tested:**

* **OS RNG** (system default)
* **Java RNG** (`java.util.Random`)
* **Python RNG** (`random` module)

**Tests applied:**

1. **Chi-Square Test (Chi)** – checks the uniformity of generated numbers.
2. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (KS)** – checks cumulative distribution deviations.

**Confidence levels used:** 0.95, 0.99

**Seeds used:** 101, 202, 303, 404, 505, 606, 707, 808, 909, 1001, 1101, 1201, 1301

## Usage Instructions

1. **Navigate to the `scripts` folder:**

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

2. **Run all tests for a specific RNG, test type, and confidence level:**

   ```bash
   ./run_all.sh <rng: os|python|java> <test: chi|ks> <confidence: 0.95|0.99>
   ```

3. **Example commands:**

   ```bash
   ./run_all.sh os chi 0.95
   ./run_all.sh os chi 0.99
   ./run_all.sh os ks 0.95
   ./run_all.sh os ks 0.99
   ./run_all.sh java chi 0.95
   ./run_all.sh java chi 0.99
   ./run_all.sh java ks 0.95
   ./run_all.sh java ks 0.99
   ./run_all.sh python chi 0.95
   ./run_all.sh python chi 0.99
   ./run_all.sh python ks 0.95
   ./run_all.sh python ks 0.99
   ```

4. **Compilation (for Java):**

   ```bash
   javac -d ../java/ ../java/rng_java.java
   ```

5. **Make sure Python and OS executables are accessible in their respective folders.**

| OS     | Chi  | 0.99       | None             | All sequences random         |
| OS     | KS   | 0.95       | None             | All sequences random         |
| OS     | KS   | 0.99       | None             | All sequences random         |
| Java   | Chi  | 0.95       | None             | All sequences random         |
| Java   | Chi  | 0.99       | None             | All sequences random         |
| Java   | KS   | 0.95       | 404, 1201        | Two sequences failed KS test |
| Java   | KS   | 0.99       | 404, 1201        | Two sequences failed KS test |
| Python | Chi  | 0.95       | None             | All sequences random         |
| Python | Chi  | 0.99       | None             | All sequences random         |
| Python | KS   | 0.95       | 505              | One sequence failed KS test  |
| Python | KS   | 0.99       | 505              | One sequence failed KS test  |

> **Note:** The `KS` test can occasionally flag a sequence as non-random due to statistical fluctuations even if the generator is good.

## Interpretation

1. **Chi-Square Test:**

   * All RNGs passed Chi-square tests for both confidence levels.
   * Indicates that the number distributions are approximately uniform.

2. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:**

   * Java RNG had 2 failures at both confidence levels.
   * Python RNG had 1 failure at both confidence levels.
   * OS RNG passed all KS tests.

**Conclusion:** Overall, the RNGs are statistically acceptable for randomness. Failures in KS tests are minor and expected due to random sample variations.

## Notes

* Make sure to run the script from the `scripts` directory or adjust paths in `run_all.sh` accordingly.
* All generated sequences and test results are stored in the corresponding RNG/test folders.
* Confidence levels influence the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis of randomness.
